; Consistency checks for execution tracing.

; Similar to the fact that RUNNING nodes should be children of RUNNING nodes
; tracing spans should be contained within another span. By definition we
; assume that when tracing is enabled there is a valid execution span and use
; this as an indicator.

; This file checks whether those assumptions are satisfied.
